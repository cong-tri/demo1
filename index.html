          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            If you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted juggling and circus
            products, the J-Prop Shop is the store for you. I've designed and
            built props for the past 35 years, and my products have been used by
            professional entertainers and hobbyists throughout the world. Our
            prices are reasonable and our quality is excellent.

          <h2>Specials This Month</h2>
          <p>
            The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for
            the entire month of May:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Stick ($19.95)</strong> The easiest stick to learn
              with, but "grippy" enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in
              red, green, and blue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flower Stick ($24.95)</strong> A graceful stick with
              colored tassels. Flower Sticks fl oat slowly, making them ideal
              for beginners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Master Stick ($39.95) </strong>
              Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and
              more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom
              colors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Glow Stick ($29.95) </strong>
              The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a
              fire stick).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Quality Tested</h2>
          <p>
            Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out
            to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my juggling
            props and I want my customers to feel that same pride.
